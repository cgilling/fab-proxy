# We're back!

Seeing the [The Pitch Zone](https://thepitchzone.com/) has recently updated their card information, I was able to easily update this tool to be up to date up to Everfest.


# FAB Proxy

A tool to help with printing out proxy cards for Flesh and Blood. Check it out in action [here](https://cgilling.github.io/fab-proxy/).

## Caveat

This was a fun project I threw together and used it as a way to play around with React. I have very little front end experience, and haven't (yet) gone through the trouble to actually have the code organized in a good fashion. So please be kind if you happen to read through the code (I agree, its a mess!).

## Deploying to Github Pages (note to self)

```bash
npm run deploy
```
